### 👋 Hello

I'm a **data scientist** and open-source developer with expertise in **economics** and **statistical inference**.  I have experience with data science projects in sectors such as e-commerce, higher education & healthcare. 👛🎓🩺  I like uncovering patterns from the depths of unstructured data and influencing how people make important business decisions or deploy software - whether they be product teams, executives and the like. 🕵

Check out my open-source library for regression modelling in Python: [`appelpy`](https://github.com/mfarragher/appelpy) (Applied Econometrics Library for Python) 🍏🥧.

I enjoy [speaking](https://github.com/mfarragher/mfarragher.github.io/blob/master/index.md#talks-) about data, writing about data projects and sharing resources about data! ⚗
